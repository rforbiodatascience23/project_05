# Presentation Group 5

## Introduction

Data from undefined A Hidradenitis Suppurativa Molecular Disease Signature Derived from Patient Samples by High-Throughput RNA Sequencing available on GEO 
RNASeq results for 40 samples.


## Materials and Methods

We read the data from GSE151243

``` {.r code-line-numbers="3"}
# Loading the data
path_gene = "../data/_raw/GSE151243_Raw_gene_counts_matrix.txt"
path_meta = "../data/_raw/GSE151243_series_matrix.txt"
gene_table <- read.table(path_gene, header = TRUE)
meta_table <- read.table(path_meta, skip = 33, fill = TRUE, header = TRUE)
```
