# Presentation Group 5


## Introduction

Data from undefined A Hidradenitis Suppurativa Molecular Disease Signature Derived from Patient Samples by High-Throughput RNA Sequencing available on GEO RNASeq results for 40 samples.

## Data Cleaning

- Start with 58051 genes in the pool
  - Remove gene if 0 expression for all patients (-6098)
  - Remove gene if expression linear model coefficient not significant (p>0.05) (-51437)
  - Remove gene if expression change < 3-fold between the diseased tissue groups (-29)
  
- 487 Genes remain for analysis



## Materials and Methods

We read the data from GSE151243

``` {.r code-line-numbers="3"}
# Loading the data
path_gene = "../data/_raw/GSE151243_Raw_gene_counts_matrix.txt"
path_meta = "../data/_raw/GSE151243_series_matrix.txt"
gene_table <- read.table(path_gene, header = TRUE)
meta_table <- read.table(path_meta, skip = 33, fill = TRUE, header = TRUE)
```

## Discussion

When you click the **Render** button a presentation will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
