## Introduction

Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a common, debilitating inflammatory skin disease linked to immune dysregulation and abnormalities in follicular structure and function. The study we looked at tries to derive an expression-based HS disease signature by observing affected and unaffected skin from 20 subjects and characterize a transcriptomic profile through RNASeq. Differential expression and pathway enrichment analyses were then performed, and the results were compared to previously reported datasets.

\
We obtained the RNASeq data used for the study - A Hidradenitis Suppurativa Molecular Disease Signature Derived from Patient Samples by High-Throughput RNA Sequencing, available on GEO RNASeq results for 40 samples - and tried to replicate the differential expression profiling and pathway enrichment analyses.

## Load

We read the data from GSE151243

``` {.r code-line-numbers="3"}
# Loading the data
path_gene = "../data/_raw/GSE151243_Raw_gene_counts_matrix.txt"
path_meta = "../data/_raw/GSE151243_series_matrix.txt"
gene_table <- read.table(path_gene, header = TRUE)
meta_table <- read.table(path_meta, skip = 33, fill = TRUE, header = TRUE)
```

## Data Cleaning

-   Start with [58051]{style="color:red;"} genes in the pool
    1.  Remove gene if 0 expression for all patients ([-6098]{style="color:orange;"})
    2.  Remove gene if expression linear model coefficient not significant between diseased/healthy tissue (p\>0.05) ([-51437]{style="color:orange;"})
    3.  Remove gene if expression change for all patients \< 3-fold between the diseased/healthy tissue groups ( [-29]{style="color:orange;"})
-   [487]{style="color:green;"} genes advance to analysis rounds

## Functional Assessment of Upregulated and Downregulated Genes

-   Upregulated genes:
    -   **NTRK1:** Neuronal survival and Signal Transduction\\n(MAPK, PI3K-Akt, PLC-$\gamma$)
    -   **POU2AF1:** B-Cell immune responds
    -   **SIGLEC7:** Inhibition of NK-Cell responds
-   Downregulated genes:
    -   **KRT77:** Kreatin, Intermediate filament protein
    -   **CHRM1:** Muscarinic receptor
    -   **PHYHIP:** Fatty acid metabolism and perioxisomal function

## Enhanced Activation of Inflammatory, Innate and Adaptive immune pathway

## Discussion

-   Observations by Freudenberg et al.
    -   Gene Upregulation
        -   MMP1, C-X-C, SERPINB4, and S100.
    -   Enhanced Immune Responses
        -   Upregulation in both adaptive and innate immune system functions.
    -   Reduced Keratinization and Intermediate Filament Activity
-   Potential Causes for Variance in Results
    -   Model Selection
        -   lm vs glm, Empirical Bayes
    -   Adjusted P-value Cutoff Choices
    -   Gene Selection Criteria
        -   Focus only on protein-encoding genes
