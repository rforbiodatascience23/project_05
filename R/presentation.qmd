## Introduction

Data from undefined A Hidradenitis Suppurativa Molecular Disease Signature Derived from Patient Samples by High-Throughput RNA Sequencing available on GEO RNASeq results for 40 samples.

## Trace the Flow of the Project

![](../pictures/flowchart_cut.png)

## Load

We read the data from GSE151243

``` {.r code-line-numbers="3"}
# Loading the data
path_gene = "../data/_raw/GSE151243_Raw_gene_counts_matrix.txt"
path_meta = "../data/_raw/GSE151243_series_matrix.txt"
gene_table <- read.table(path_gene, header = TRUE)
meta_table <- read.table(path_meta, skip = 33, fill = TRUE, header = TRUE)
```

## Data Cleaning

-   Start with 58051 genes in the pool
    -   Remove gene if 0 expression for all patients (-6098)
    -   Remove gene if expression linear model coefficient not significant (p\>0.05) (-51437)
    -   Remove gene if expression change \< 3-fold between the diseased tissue groups (-29)
-   487 Genes remain for analysis

## Functional Assessment of Upregulated and Downregulated Genes

-   Upregulated genes:
    -   **NTRK1:** Neuronal survival and Signal Transduction\\n(MAPK, PI3K-Akt, PLC-$\gamma$)
    -   **POU2AF1:** B-Cell immune responds
    -   **SIGLEC7:** Inhibition of NK-Cell responds
-   Downregulated genes:
    -   **KRT77:** Kreatin, Intermediate filament protein
    -   **CHRM1:** Muscarinic receptor
    -   **PHYHIP:** Fatty acid metabolism and perioxisomal function

## Enhanced Activation of Inflammatory, Innate and Adaptive immune pathway

## Discussion

-   Observations by Freudenberg et al.
    -   Gene Upregulation
        -   MMP1, C-X-C, SERPINB4, and S100.
    -   Enhanced Immune Responses
        -   Upregulation in both adaptive and innate immune system functions.
    -   Reduced Keratinization and Intermediate Filament Activity
-   Potential Causes for Variance in Results
    -   Model Selection
        -   lm vs glm, Empirical Bayes
    -   Adjusted P-value Cutoff Choices
    -   Gene Selection Criteria
        -   Focus only on protein-encoding genes
